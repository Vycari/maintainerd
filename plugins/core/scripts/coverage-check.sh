# coverage-check.sh — the coverage ratchet gate.
#
# Reads the normalized summary (`{"metric": "lines", "percent": <float>}`, produced by
# coverage-adapt.sh) and the repo's `coverage.floor` from .claude/maintainerd.json, and
# fails when the measured percentage is below the floor. Equal passes: the floor is the
# lowest acceptable value, not a value to beat.
#
# Canonical source: maintainerd, plugins/core/scripts/coverage-check.sh
# A consuming repo carries a copy at .claude/maintainerd/coverage-check.sh so CI can run
# it without the plugin installed. Re-copy it when maintainerd-core updates.
#
#   coverage-check.sh
#   coverage-check.sh --summary build/coverage-summary.json
#   coverage-check.sh --floor 80        # override the config, for a local what-if
#
# There are no tool-specific threshold flags anywhere in the pipeline: the gate is this
# one shell step in every repo, and the number it reads lives in one tracked file, so
# lowering it is a reviewable diff rather than an invisible edit to a workflow.
#
# The workflow uploads the summary as an artifact named `coverage`; `doctor` reads that
# artifact from the latest default-branch run. See the workflow snippet in the plugin's
# references/config-schema.md.
#
# Requires: bash 3.2+, jq.
#
# Fails closed. A missing summary, malformed JSON, or an absent floor is an error, never
# a pass — every one of those states is indistinguishable from "the tests did not run",
# and a gate that waves those through is a gate that has never once fired.
